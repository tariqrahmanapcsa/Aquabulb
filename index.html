		<p class = "lead"> 		Dehydration is an ongoing issue in our society today. People just don’t seem to have the time. Many people have trouble maintaining a healthy level of water in their system.  Unfortunately, when people consistently don’t drink enough water, side effects are often produced. These effects include headaches, dry skin, dry mouth, dizziness, and drowsiness. All of these are effects of only mild dehydration. To prevent this, the average person should have a daily water intake of 3.7 liters (for men) and 2.7 liters (for women). HydroFlasks have become a popular tool to help hydrate students at our school. Hydroflasks ranges from 24 -64 ounces, although the most common lean toward the lower end. One liter is equal to 33 ounces, so we can assume that most students consume an average of about 30 ounces per day at school. With school taking up a majority of the day, only a few hours remain to consume the other two liters. Ultimately, if students continue heading down this path, their academic performance will be compromised, all because of the lack of water. Our product can also help with sports performance by increasing stamina and endurance by preventing dehydration. Ultimately, solving dehydration in many ways, all of which can be beneficial to you, the consumer!

		<h2> How It Works </h2>
		<p>After conducting extensive research we have created a design to satisfy the growing problem of dehydration. Our solution takes its form as a small, bulb-shaped device that can be attached to any water bottle from any material using a loop. It will have the tracking ability to interpret how much water you have drunk throughout a twenty-four hour period and implement this into its Bluetooth system. This system allows the Aqua-Bulb to send reminders directly to your phone in an effort to reach your personal goal by the end of the day. These different capabilities require specific sensors and material to achieve peak functionality. Several sensors are required to create a working product. These sensors, as mentioned previously in the Research Summary, include the Inertia Sensor, Bluetooth Receiver RF Transceiver, 555 Timer IC, a CR2032 Coin Cell battery, and an Ambient Light Sensor. </p>
